# _ATM-ConsoleInterface_

## Description
A small console application in which I try to simulate the interface of a basic ATM,
with small functionality added such as deposit or withdraw money or check balance.

## Installation
Lorem ipsum

## Usage 
At the beginning, the user is asked to introduce the PIN of the account(2 hardcoded users)

After you intput the right PIN, you are prompted to a menu from where you can chose which which transaction you want to do

When you're done, you can choose *"n"*, when the question "Do you want to do another transaction?" appears
